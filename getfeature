#get the labels

#this is the code you could find in Google Cloud Vision's official website, what I have done was to change the path and import my pictures to this function, and choose how many labels for each picture I want to print.

def detect_labels(path):
    client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
    i = 1
    for i in range(len(photos)):
        Path = path+ str(i+1) +'.jpg'
        with io.open(Path, 'rb') as image_file:
            content = image_file.read()
        num = 1
        image = vision.types.Image(content=content)
        response = client.label_detection(image=image)
        labels = response.label_annotations[0:3]
        print('Labels:')
        for label in labels:
            print('The label %d of %d.jpg is %s:'%(num,i,label.description))
            num += 1
